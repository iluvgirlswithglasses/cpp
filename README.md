# My Competitive Programming Workspace

I'm dumb but I'm tryin'

# Structures

This repository serves all purposes. In other words, it's a mess.

Many of the codes are out-dated. Don't look at files which are writen before June 2021 unless you're into gore.

- `/algorithms`: Implementations of algorithm & data structure theories. The most out-dated of the codebase, might optimize soon.
- `/contest`: My works on contests' problems. Some are online *(freecontest, codeforces,...)*, some are offline *(olp, national,...)*.
- `/pages`: Online CP pages' problems except ![oj.vnoi.info](https://oj.vnoi.info/), since vnoi is too special they need a seperated region.
- `/tools`: Some tools to make coding easy. Template Generator should be here too, but I moved it to `iluvgirlswithglasses/general-apps`.
- `/trick`: C++ tricks and syntaxes that are easy to forget, but crucial to remember... Or I thought so. This folder is somewhat even more out-dated than `/algorithms`
- `/vnoj`: Here dwell my solutions of *![Vietnam Online Judge](https://oj.vnoi.info/)*'s problems.
- `/workshop`: Place for files I don't know where to place.
