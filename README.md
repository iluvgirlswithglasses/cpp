# My Competitive Programming Workspace

I'm dumb but I'm tryin'  
I use Arch BTW

# Structures

This repository serves all purposes. In other words, it's a mess *(but it's less miserable than me)*

Many of the codes are out-dated. Don't look at files which are writen before June 2021 unless you're into gore.

- `./algorithms`: Implementations of algorithm & data structure theories. The most out-dated of the codebase, might be optimized soon.
- `./contest`: My works on contests' problems. Some are online *(freecontest, codeforces,...)*, some are offline *(olp, national,...)*.
- `./pages`: Online CP pages' problems except [oj.vnoi.info](https://oj.vnoi.info/), since vnoi is too special they need a seperated region.
- `./tools`: Some tools to make coding easy. Template Generator should be here too, but I moved it to `iluvgirlswithglasses/general-apps/` and `iluvgirlswithglasses/arch-tools/`.
- `./trick`: C++ tricks and syntaxes that are easy to forget, but crucial to remember... Or I thought so. This folder is somewhat even more out-dated than `./algorithms`
- `./vnoj`: Here dwell my solutions of *[Vietnam Online Judge](https://oj.vnoi.info/)*'s problems. *[My VNOI account](https://oj.vnoi.info/user/iluvgirlswithglasses)*, if you care. I reached top #69 on 28-Nov-2021 btw.
- `./workshop`: Place for files I don't know where to place.

Thus, I should put anime girls everywhere I go too!
