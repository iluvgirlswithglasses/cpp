My most important contest of all these 12 years

Theme: *memento*  
Hopeless, but whatever...

I had no competitive programming experience in the last two contests: No VNOI, no Codeforces... and still performed well.  
Now, I ranked #41 on VNOI. Yet, ironically, this is the only time I put on the hopeless theme. Compete for the top #6 is really something else...
