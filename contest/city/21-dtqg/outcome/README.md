I lost hope when I were there. I knew that everything was over, I wouldn't have the chance to participate in VOI. So I thought it would be a better choice if I just come back to an ordinary student life and prepare for the countless upcoming tests.

But when I saw that picture - the picture taken by someone in the team without me even asking - I realized that I may have made a mistake. Sure [this kind of exams](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E1%BB%B3_thi_trung_h%E1%BB%8Dc_ph%E1%BB%95_th%C3%B4ng_qu%E1%BB%91c_gia_(Vi%E1%BB%87t_Nam)) is kinda a big thing in Vietnam. But who the fuck cares? It's just something EVERYONE does. Now I kinda regret that I chose to study for those mundane exams rather than learning CP with those guys. Those are really, really good guys, much better than I am at pretty much everything.
