My most important contest of all these 12 years

Theme: *memento*  
Hopeless, but whatever...

I had no competitive programming experience in the last two contests: No VNOI, no Codeforces... and still performed well.  
Now, I ranked #41 on VNOI. Yet, ironically, this is the only time I put on the hopeless theme. Compete for the top #6 is really something else...

Before contest: Duvet was chose to be the second theme.  
Feeling neutral. No hope but no pain whatsoever.

After day 1: Obokuri-Eeumi was chose to be the ending theme.  
I have one day left but... It's over now? Kither had 2.5/3 done. I had 1.5. And there's even a guy from Tran Dai Nghia who destroyed 3/3 within 1.5 hours. I mean... yeah no one have known the result just yet but... What's the point now
